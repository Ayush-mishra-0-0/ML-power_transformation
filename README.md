# ML-power_transformation

## Overview

The "ML-power_transformation" project is aimed at applying power transformations to a dataset to make it more normally distributed. The primary objective is to improve the accuracy of statistical algorithms, such as regression, when applied to the transformed data.

## Motivation

Many statistical and machine learning algorithms assume that data is normally distributed. When your data doesn't meet this assumption, the accuracy and performance of these algorithms may suffer. Power transformations can be applied to data to make it conform more closely to a normal distribution, which can lead to improved model performance.

## Features

- Apply power transformation to the dataset.
- Utilize various power transformation methods (e.g., Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson).
- Implement machine learning models on the transformed data.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ayush-mishra-0-0/ML-power_transformation.git
    ```

2. **Installation:**

    To run this project on your local machine, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required libraries by creating a virtual environment and running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the model:**

   Execute the project and celebrate your success! You can run machine learning algorithms of your choice. I have used Linear Regression, but you can select any other algorithm that suits your needs.
